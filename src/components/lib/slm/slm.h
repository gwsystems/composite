	 * rcv_suspended: Tracks the kernel state of the AEP threads for whether they're
	 *                suspended on cos_rcv or not.
	 *		  rcv_suspended is used only for threads that are AEPs (call cos_rcv).
	 *
	 * Activations of these AEP threads cannot be fully controlled by the
	 * scheduler and depends on the global quality of the TCap associated with this
	 * AEP at any point an `asnd` happens to this AEP.
	 *
	 * Therefore, this is really not a thread state that the scheduler controls.
	 * if a thread has rcv_suspended set, it doesn't mean that it isn't running.
	 * But if the thread uses any of `sl` block/yield, this should first be reset and
	 * the thread must be put back to run-queue before doing anything!!
	 *
	 * Another important detail is, when the scheduler receives a "unblocked" event, it
	 * resets this. If rcv_suspended == 0, then the scheduler does not modify the thread states!
	 * This is because, a thread could have run without the scheduler's knowledge through the
	 * tcap mechanism and may have eventually tried to block/acquire a lock/futex
	 * which would then block the thread at user-level. A kernel scheduling event
	 * should not cause it to change to RUNNABLE state and enter a critical section when
	 * it isn't it's turn!
	 *
	 * This is the strongest motivation towards not combining user-level and kernel-level
	 * thread states.
	 *
	 * To sum up:
	 * if rcv_suspended: A thread could "still" be calling block/yield and therefore be
	 *                   in a RUNNABLE/BLOCKED/BLOCKED_TIMEOUT states. It could also be
	 *                   woken up at the user-level if there is another high-prio thread
	 *                   and that gets to run before scheduler is activated up on this
	 *                   thread calls block/yield and it then wakes this thread up.
	 * if !rcv_suspended: A thread could be in any state and also be in cos_rcv.
	 *
	 * The only thing this captures is, "unblocking" a thread from cos_rcv or "blocking" it
	 * on cos_rcv from a scheduler's context. BLOCKing a thread when the scheduler processes
	 * a "blocked" kernel event, clears any prior thread states and sets it to be BLOCKED/BLOCKED_TIMEOUT.

 *
 * 3. We don't see someone owning the lock, *but* we race on updating
 *     the lock to us as the owner, and the other thread wins. Instead
 *     of trying to do option 2 here we return an error so that the

 *     we're currently executing the thread, so we simply need to
 *     ensure that the `slm_thd` for a thread is live as long as the
 *     thread is live...something that is fairly natural.

 * - @ret - `0` if we have the critical section, `1` if there was a
 *     race on setting the lock, and we lost, `-N` for errors on the
 *     kernel call to switch threads, including `-EAGAIN` if there was
