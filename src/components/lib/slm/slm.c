	 * FIXME: if there is a owner holding the lock, the owner should also be in the scheduler component.
	 * If we use g->timeout_next as the argument of cos_defswitch's timeout parameter when the owner is 
	 * not a scheduler thread, deadlock could happen. The reason is: because the non-scheduler thread is 
	 * in the critical section while the scheduler thread is trying to enter this critical section, each
	 * time when the scheduler tries to switch to the owner thread, it uses g->timeout_next to switch to
	 * the owner. However, since the scheduler cannot update g->timeout_next because it does not gain the
	 * lock at this point of time, the timeout value g->timeout_next is a old value. Then, when the kernel
	 * tries to switch to the owner, it will set the timer interrupt with current actual time plus a small
	 * latency compensate. The problem here is because the timer interrupt is set to be a very near future,
	 * it could happen that before the kernel really switches into the owner, the timer interrrupt has been
	 * fired. Thus, when it comes into the first instruction of owner code, it will immediately be interrupted
	 * and then switch back to the scheduler thread here. Becuase the scheduler thread again doesn't gain the
	 * lock, it will use the same old g->timeout_next value to have the same switch request, which causes a deadlock. 
	 * 
	 * As a result, we use TCAP_TIME_NIL here, which tells the kernel to disable the timer interrupt for the
	 * owner thread. Because we know the owner thread at this point of time is in the scheduler componet, thus
	 * it is trusted to disable the timer interrupt. After the owner thread properly exits the critical section,
	 * it will have chance to do scheduling decisions which will enable timer interrupt again for other non-trusted
	 * components' thread.
	 * 
	 * However, this could cause problems when we have other types of interrupt like nic interrupt because that type
	 * of interrupt could directly switch to the user level component (like a nic component). If this happens while
	 * the timer interrupt is disabled, it will casue problem. Thue, we currently assume there is no other type of
	 * interrupt except the timer interrupt.
