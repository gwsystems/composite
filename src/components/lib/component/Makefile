# The .o files that are mandatorily linked into dependents. This is
# rarely used, and only when normal .a linking rules will avoid
# linking some necessary objects. This list is of names (for example,
# component) which will generate component.lib.o. Do NOT include the list of .o
# files here. Please note that using this list is *very rare* and
# should only be used when the .a support above is not appropriate.

# dependents to compile with (./ by default). Will be fed into the -I

# is a list of directory names in interface/)

# *minimal*. That is to say that removing a dependency should cause
# the build to fail. The build system does not validate this
# minimality; that's on you!

# There are two different *types* of Makefiles for libraries.
# 1. Those that are Composite-specific, and simply need an easy way to
#    compile and itegrate their code.
# 2. Those that aim to integrate external libraries into
#    Composite. These focus on "driving" the build process of the
#    external library, then pulling out the resulting files and
#    directories. These need to be flexible as all libraries are
#    different.

# Type 1, Composite library: This is the default Makefile for
# libraries written for composite. Get rid of this if you require a
# custom Makefile (e.g. if you use an existing
# (non-composite-specific) library. An example of this is `kernel`.
include Makefile.lib

## Type 2, external library: If you need to specialize the Makefile
## for an external library, you can add the external code as a
## subdirectory, and drive its compilation, and integration with the
## system using a specialized Makefile. The Makefile must generate
## lib$(LIBRARY_OUTPUT).a and $(OBJECT_OUTPUT).lib.o, and have all of
## the necessary include paths in $(INCLUDE_PATHS).
##
## To access the Composite Makefile definitions, use the following. An
## example of a Makefile written in this way is in `ps/`.
#
# include Makefile.src Makefile.comp Makefile.minlib
# .PHONY: all clean init distclean
## Fill these out with your implementation
# all:
# clean:
#
## Default rules:
# init: clean all
# distclean: clean
