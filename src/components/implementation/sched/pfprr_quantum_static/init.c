/**
 * Initialization of the scheduler, and all of the components the
 * scheduler is responsible for initializing. Note that the `init`
 * interface is what encodes which components are dependent on the
 * scheduler for initialization. If the scheduler is managed by the
 * capmgr, then the capmgr must have access to the captbl/pgtbl/comp
 * capabilities for the component, thus it must also depend on the
 * capmgr for the capmgr_create interface.
 *
 * The current implementation is not ideal in multiple ways.
 *
 * 1. It does not provide parallel execution.
 * 2. It executes the initialization of the client components during
 *    the *main* execution of this scheduler. That means that
 *    initialization does *not* compose correctly. For example,
 *    consider a component, `a`, that relies on another initialization
 *    component, and also depends on a component, `b`, that depends on
 *    us for initialization. We will finish initialization, and allow
 *    initialization to proceed in `a`, *before* we actually
 *    initialize `b`. This breaks the initialization ordering
 *    requirements. It doesn't make much sense to have such
 *    cross-scheduler dependencies, so this is less of an issue than
 *    it seems.
 *
 * The former is simple because it is TBD. The latter is because the
 * scheduler loop executes in `main`, and we orchestrate
 * initialization within the normal scheduling loop. To fix this, we'd
 * have to move a version of the scheduling loop (that returns
 * sporadically) to `parallel_init`.
